    "If there is a lot of variance (spread of data away from the mean) within the data groups, then there is more chance that the mean of a sample selected from the data will be different due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as looking at variance within the data groups, ANOVA takes into account sample size (the larger the sample, the less chance there will be of picking outliers for the sample by chance) and the differences between sample means (if the means of the samples are far apart, it’s more likely that the means of the whole group will be too).\n",

A two-way ANOVA can then simultaneously assess the effect on these variables on your dependent variable (spending) and determine whether they make a difference."
